# Rule: one command per Bash tool call

Claude Code does not support chained, piped, or stderr-redirected shell commands. A
multi-command Bash call produces errors or silent data loss, and the `cd <path> && git ...`
pattern specifically triggers a security prompt that cannot be bypassed. This rule governs
how every agent (main sessions, subagents, worktree agents, commands, and skills) invokes the
Bash tool. It is the project's number one operational rule.

## The rule

Every Bash tool call MUST contain exactly ONE command.

- **Forbidden operators:** `&&`, `||`, `|`, `;`, `2>/dev/null`, `2>&1`.
- **Use dedicated tools instead of shell text:**
  - `Read` (with `offset` / `limit`) replaces `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`.
  - `Grep` replaces `grep`, `rg`, and any pipe into `grep`.
  - `Glob` replaces `find` and `ls` for file discovery.
  - `Write` replaces `echo` redirection and `cat <<EOF`.
  - The Bash `timeout` parameter replaces `sleep`.
  - Run commands in separate Bash calls instead of joining them with `&&`, `;`, or `||`.
- **Git in another directory:** always use `git -C <path> ...`. Never `cd <path> && git ...`.

This applies everywhere with no exceptions: main sessions, subagents, worktree agents,
commands, and skills.

## Enforcement (self-maintaining)

- **Hook (blocking):** `scripts/bash-guard.js` runs as a `PreToolUse` hook (registered in
  `.claude/settings.json`) and denies any Bash command that contains a forbidden operator
  outside quotes.

## Scope

Governs the Bash tool only. Operators inside quoted strings (e.g. `echo "a && b"`, a grep
regex `"a|b"`) are allowed because they are arguments, not command separators. This rule is
about how an agent invokes commands, not about shell scripts committed under `scripts/`, which
run outside the agent and may use normal shell syntax (the GitHub Actions workflows under
`.github/workflows/` are exempt for this reason).
